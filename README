You need to be installed json-server, 'npm install -g json-server'. 
Launch the server launch.sh or 'json-server --watch db.json'


There is a problem with the data about work hours in db.json, there's no information about barberId, so I hardcoded that any barber works at the same time. 

Given db.json contains this:
    {
      "id": 1,
      "day": 1,
      "startHour": 7,
      "endHour": "15"
    },

So I decided that "day" is a weekday number (1-7, Monday-Sunday) and used only first 5 elements of workHours in db.json.
